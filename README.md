# Neural Network Visualization in 3D
This visualization of a neural network uses the capabilities of Qt Quick 3D.

## Getting Started
1. Download the MNIST train dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
2. Put `train-images.idx3-ubyte` and `train-labels.idx1-ubyte` in the `bin/data/` folder.
3. Make `bin` your working directory.
4. Compile using Qt 6 (has been tested with Qt 6.2.4).
